### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tommy Kronkvist, a Swedish chess enthusiast, Macintosh aficionado and amateur ichthyologist.

I'm currently one of 6 _bureaucrats_ at **Wikispecies** (thus also one of their 27 regular administrators) and as of this writing one of their only two _interface administrators_. I'm also one of three admins of the Swedish language version of **Wikivoyage** and one of 19 admininistrators at **Wikimedia Sverige** ("WMSE"), the Swedish national **Wikimedia Foundation** chapter that hosted the 2019 _Wikimania Conference_ in Stockholm.

I'm registered at **Phabricator**, a development collaboration tool used for Wiki software development.
